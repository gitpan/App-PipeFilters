=head1 NAME

jsonpath - use JSON::Path to cut out selected portions of JSON objects

=head1 VERSION

version 0.001

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  jsonpath [--verbose] -o json_path_1 [-o json_path_2 ...] [file ...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

jsonpath(1) cuts out selected portions of each JSON record and writes
them to standard output.  Fields are selected using JSON::Path
expressions, which are a Perl-centric variant of JSONPath.  Multiple
fields may be specified, one per -o flag.

Output fields are named col#, where the # is the numeric position of
the corresponding JSON::Path expression on the command line.  The
first column is col0.  jmap(1) may be used to give each output field a
more useful name.
