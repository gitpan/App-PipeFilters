=head1 NAME


=head1 VERSION

version 0.001
App::PipeFilter::JsonMap - map input fields to output fields by
renaming them

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  #!/usr/bin/perl
  use App::PipeFilter::JsonMap;
  exit App::PipeFilter::JsonMap->new_with_options()->run();

=head1 DESCRIPTION

App::PipeFilter::JsonMap implements the jmap(1) pipeline filter.  It
renames JSON object fields by mapping input field names to new ones on
output.

This class subclasses L<App::PipeFilter::Generic::Json>.

=head1 PUBLIC ATTRIBUTES

=head2 i

The i() attribute holds an arrayref of one or more input fields to be
renamed.  All other input fields will be present in the resulting
output without being renamed.  MooseX::Getopt sets i() to the values
of the -i options from the command line.

=head2 o

The o() attribute holds an arrayref of the new names of the fields
from i().  Both i() and o() must have the same number of field names.
MooseX::Getopt sets o() to the values of the -o options from the
command line.

=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

=head2 transform

The transform() method renames the fields named in the i() attribute
to the names found in the o() attribute.
