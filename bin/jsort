=head1 NAME

jsort - sort input files of JSON objects on key fields

=head1 VERSION

version 0.001

=head1 SYNOPSIS

	jsort [-n] [-r] -k field_name [-k field_name] [--verbose] [file ...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Write a sorted concatenation of all input JSON objects to standard
output.  Modeled after sort(1), except that key fields are specified
by JSON names rather than field positions.

-r flags are passed directly to it.
