=head1 NAME


=head1 VERSION

version 0.001
App::PipeFilter::Role::Flags::Standard - provide attributes and getopt
parsing for standard pipeline filter flags

=head1 SYNOPSIS

This isn't a complete module because App::PipeFilter::Generic is one
of the largest modules, weighing in at some 40-ish lines.

  package App::PipeFilter::Generic;

  use Moose;
  with 'App::PipeFilter::Role::Flags::Standard';

  ... implementation goes here ....

=head1 DESCRIPTION

App::PipeFilter::Role::Flags::Standard provides standard pipeline
filter attributes and consumes MooseX::Getopt to populate them from
command line arguments.

=head1 PUBLIC ATTRIBUTES

=head2 verbose

The boolean verbose attribute (set by the --verbose command line flag)
optionally enables additional progress and status messages on standard
error.

Use with caution.  Some pipeline filters may use standard error for
their own purposes.

=head1 PUBLIC METHODS

=head2 next_input_file

next_input_file() returns the next input file name from the command
line.  If no file was named, it returns "-" representing STDIN.
