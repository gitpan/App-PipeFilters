App::PipeFilter::Role::Opener::GenericInput - a common method to open
input files

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  package App::PipeFilter::Role::Opener::GenericIO;

  use Moose::Role;

  with qw(
    App::PipeFilter::Role::Opener::GenericInput
    App::PipeFilter::Role::Opener::GenericOutput

=head1 DESCRIPTION

App::PipeFilter::Role::Opener::GenericInput provides a generic
open_input() method to open named input files, devices or streams.  It
opens STDIN when the input file is named "-" (which is often the
default).

L<App::PipeFilter::Generic> uses open_input() to open the input files
specified on the command line.  Opening files is done in a dedicated
method so it may be augmented or overridden in subclasses.

L<App::PipeFilter> has top-level documentation including a table of
contents for all the libraries and utilities included in the project.
