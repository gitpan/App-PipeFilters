Here is the class that makes up the jcat(1) utility.  It reads JSON,
does no transformations on the deserialized data, and writes new JSON
one object per line.

  package App::PipeFilter::JsonCat;

  use Moose;
  extends 'App::PipeFilter::Generic::Json';
  with 'App::PipeFilter::Role::Transform::None';

=head1 DESCRIPTION

App::PipeFilter::Role::Transform::None provides a transform() method
that returns its parameters without altering them.

L<App::PipeFilter::Generic> uses transform() to modify the contents of
streams being filtered.

The "None" transform is commonly used in filters that translate data
from one file or stream format to another without changing it.
