=head1 DESCRIPTION

App::PipeFilter::Generic::Json is a generic base class for pipeline
filters that read and write streams of JSON objects.

It subclasses L<App::PipeFilter::Generic> and customizes it with the
following roles: L<App::PipeFilter::Role::Reader::Sysread>,
L<App::PipeFilter::Role::Input::Json> and
L<App::PipeFilter::Role::Output::Json>.

Further customization is done by implementing a transform() method or
consuming a role that implements one.  L<App::PipeFilter::JsonCat>
consumes a role that does no transformation.
L<App::PipeFilter::JsonCut> implements a transform() method that
extracts certain fields.

Additional customization is possible by overriding or extending the
generic classes' methods in the usual ways.

  perldoc -m App::PipeFilter::Generic::Json

L<App::PipeFilter::Generic> documents all the methods provided by the
base class and roles.

L<App::PipeFilter> has top-level documentation including a table of
contents for all the libraries and utilities included in the project.
