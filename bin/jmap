=head1 NAME

jmap - map input JSON fields to output JSON fields by renaming them

=head1 VERSION

version 0.001

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  jmap -i original_name -o new_name [-i orig -o new ...] [file ...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

jmap(1) behaves like jcat(1) but renames fields in the process of
concatenating input files.  jmap(1) reads files sequentially, altering
some or all of their field names before writing them to standard
output.  jmap(1) can rename multiple fields by repeating its -i and -o
flags.

The -i and -o flags' unique behavior is implemented in
L<App::PipeFilter::JsonMap>.
See that module for more detailed documentation.
