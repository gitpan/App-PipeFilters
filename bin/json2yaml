=head1 NAME

json2yaml - convert files of JSON objects into a stream of YAML objects

=head1 VERSION

version 0.001

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  json2yaml [--verbose] [file ...]

=head1 DESCRIPTION

json2yaml(1) reads files sequentially, writing them as YAML to
standard output.

=head1 PRO TIPS

The YAML stream is vertical, with one field per line, whereas most of
the JSON filters write entire objects per line.

This filter is often used as the equivalent of mysql(1)'s \G command:

  ego (\G) Send command to mysql server, display result vertically.

The json_xs(1) utility can reformat JSON vertically as well, if you
prefer JSON over YAML.
